Original sources:

http://www.svenstucki.ch/hp/node/9
http://www.esl.eu/eu/tmnf/news/115154/The-new-ESL-Cupmode-/

What to do:
Download the latest manialive and set it up. http://www.manialive.com
Download the source files from GitHub. see above ^^
Extract the files towards: libraries/ManiaLivePlugins/
Set in the config.ini the following lines:

manialive.plugins[] = 'ESLCupMode\CupMode'

Then save the config and start the plugin.

The plugin has some basic things like /eslcup activate to start the special ESL mode.

/eslcup disable stops the plugin.
/eslcup restore restores the last value of config.
/eslcup limit x will set the limit for cupmode.

What to do:
- Graphical User Interface.
- Make everything work based on BeginRound, EndRound etc.
- Test everything properly out. 

If there are more ideas please contact me on MP Forum aswell as through the usual accounts.
